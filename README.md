# Daily APIs
This is basically me forcing myself to actively program. I'll try to post an API daily (mostly stuff that parses JSON and gives a simplified output) and hopefully it can be of use to someone. Every API will have it's own folder with documentation, and will be server ready. Also, none of these APIs will be tested. If you find them to be broken, let me know and I'll try to fix it.
