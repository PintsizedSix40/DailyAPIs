# Daily APIs
This is basically me forcing myself to actively program. I'll try to post an API daily (mostly stuff that parses JSON and gives a simplified output) and hopefully it can be of use to someone. Every API will have it's own folder with documentation, and will be server ready. Also, none of these APIs will be tested. If you find them to be broken, let me know and I'll try to fix it.

## License
The license for any API that were created completaly by me is:

You can do whatever you want as long as you follow these terms:
(1) I am NOT responsible for anything that comes about from using this code.
(2) You do not sell this code unmodified.
(3) You do not claim to be the author of this code when it is unmodified.

For any API that uses other code, you must follow their license when using their code and the above license for any parts of my code.
